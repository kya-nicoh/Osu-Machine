# TO-DO:
	Recognize which key to press and how long to press it
	
	Recognize when to press the said key
	
	4 Keys only
	
	Varying delay so that it would not be tracked as a bot

# PROBLEMS:
	
	Could not determine when to press keys and when to release it.
		1. When pressing a key the color of the key changes so it makes it hard
			for the bot to differentiate them when doing pixel by pixel.
		POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Screenshots
